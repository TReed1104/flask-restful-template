# Flask REST API template
## What Is This Template?
This template is the base configuration of the RESTful Flask services we deploy as part of the Asgard System Stack.

The API itself is written in Python (V3), using the Flask web microframework and its RESTful extension. The service was designed as a scalable microservice, providing reusable functionality within the system stack.
